// types of containers in _stdcall
// 1. Sequence Containers  ---> inear fashion
// 2. Associative Conatiners----> DiRECT access // it stores data in tree form set ,multiset,map,multimap
// 3. Derived Containers--->REAL WORLD MODELLING QUEUE ,STACK


when to use which 
Sequence containers 

1. vector  ---> insertion and del ---> slow 
insertion at the end ===fast;


2. list --> random access slow 
        insertion in the middle is fast 
        as compare to that of array and vector 
        insertion at the last is also fast 

Associative containers:
    All operateion fast 
    except random access 

Derived containers ---> Depends --> Data Structure
