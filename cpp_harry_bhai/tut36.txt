//CPP tutorial:
 INHERITANCE IN CPP

/* reuseability is a very important feature of OOOPS
/* in cpp we can reuse a class and add addtional features to it 
reusing classes saves times and money 
Resuing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developinig and debugging the same thing agina 


// what is inheritance in cpp
1. The concept of reuseability in cpp is  supported using inheritance
2. we can reuse the properties of an existing class by interiting from it 
the existing class in called as the Derived class
Reusing classes saves time and money 
there are different types of inherit



forms of inheritance in cpp\


..single inheritance
//a derived class with only one base class 

1. Multiple inheritance 
// a derived class with more than one base class

2. Hierarchical inheritance
.. Several derieved classes from a single base class


3. Multilevel inheritance
....deriving a class from already derived class 


4. Hybrid inheritance

it is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance 
a class is derived form two classes as in multiple inheritance 
however, one of the partent classes is not a base class.
