    // Polymorphism 
    // - one name multiple forms 
    // - eg. function overloading, operator overloading 
    // - eg. virtual function 
    /*Polymorphism are of two type 
    1. Compile time polymorphism------early and starting binding  ( acheived using function overloading and operator overloading )

    2. Run time Polymorphism  ------------>acheived is virtual function (in this type there is no binding )
