// ***********************Constructors in Derived Class********************************************

// . we can use constructors in derived classes in cpp
// . if base constuctor does not have any arguments, there is no need of any constructor in derived class
// .but if there are one or more arguments in the base class construcotr, derived class need to pass arguments to the base class constructor 
// . if both base and derived classes have constructors , base class constructor is executed first 

// . IN Multiple inheritance , base classes are constucted in the order in which they appear in the class delaration 
// . in multilevel inheritance , the constructor are executed in the order of inheritance 

 
/*******************************Special SYNTAX*********************************/
/*
. cpp supprts an special syntax for passing arguments to multiple base classes 
. The constructor of the derived class recevies all the arguments at once and then will pass the calls to the respective base classes
.The body is called after all the constructors are finished executing 

    Derived_Constructor (arg1,arg2, arg3,.....): Base1-Constructor(arg1,arg2),Base2_constructor(arg3,arg4){
        .....
    }Base1_constructor(arg1,arg2)

//Special Case of virtual Base Class

// .The constructor for virtual base classes are invoked before and nonvirtual base class
// . if there are multiple virtual base classes, they are invoked in the order delcared.
// .Any non-virtual base class are then constructed before the derived class constructor is executed
