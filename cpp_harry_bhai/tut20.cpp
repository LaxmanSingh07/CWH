//c++ langauage ws designed with the min intetaaion of adding oop features to C language 
// .. as the size of the program increases , readability ,maintinabiltiy and but-free nature of programs decreases 
// this was teh major problem with languages like c which relied upon functions or procedures(hence the name proceduaral programming language)
// Also as data was almost neglected, data security was easitly compromised 
// using classes solves this problem by modelling program as a real world scenario


//procedure oriented programming 
// 1. consits of writing set of instructions for the computer to follow 
// 2. Main focus is on fuacntion an not on flow of ddata 
// fucntio ncan either use local and global data
// data move openlu from fucntion to funciton 


//oops 

// works on the concept of classes and objects 
// a calss in a template to create objects 
// trets data as a critical elemetn 
// decoposes the problem in objects and builds data and fucntions aroound the objects 


//basic cocept in oops 

// classes-- Basic template for creating objects 
// objects -- basic run time entities 
// data abstration & encapuslation -- wrapping data and fucntion into single unit 
// inheritance -- properties of one calss can be inherited into ohters 
// polymorphism --> ability to take more than one form 
// dynamic binding-- code which will execute i s not known unit the program
// message passing--> object.message(information) call formate 


// benefits of oops 

// 1. better code reusability using onject and inheritacne. 
// 2. principle of data hiding helps build secure systems .
// 3. Multiple objects can co-exist witout any infernece 
// 4.Software complexity can be easily managed
