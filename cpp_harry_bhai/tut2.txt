The first line of our program

#include <iostream>

tells the compiler that we want to use the iostream library. The name
inside angle brackets (iostream in this case) refers to a header. Every
program that uses a library facility must include its associated header.
The #include directive must be written on a single lineâ€”the name of the
header and the #include must appear on the same line. In general,
#include directives must appear outside any function. Typically, we put all
the #include directives for a program at the beginning of the source file.
