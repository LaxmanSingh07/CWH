//A variable is a container to hold dat 
variabl can e of variouos types. Primarily we have these varaible types in cpp
1. int 
2. float 
3 char 
4. doubel 
4. boolean

//basic syntax : Data_type variable_name=Value;

ex: int a=10;
. Based on Scope, variable can be classifed into two types :
1. Local variable
2. Global varaible

/* Scope of a variable is the region in code there teh esitence of variable is valid.
Based on Scope we have local and glaobal variables in cpp
Local varaible: 
local varaible are delcared inside the braces of any fucntio and can be accessed only from there
Global varaible: 
are delcared outside any fucntion and can be accessed only from anywhere


can glaobal and local variable have same name in cpp? yes 



//CPP DATA types 
data types define the type of data a varaible can hold, for example an integer vaible can hold integer data, a characterf type variable can hold character data etc.
dat types in cpp are atergorised in three groups :
.Built-in
.User-defined
.Derived 



Built in data type 
1.int ,2.float 3.char ,4. doubel, 5. boolean

userdefined data types 
1. struct 2. enum 3. union


Derived data types :
1. Array fucntion and pointer 


// rules for declaring vaible name 

1. variable name in cpp can range form 1 to 255
2. all variable name must begin with a letter of the aphabet or an underscore_
3. after the first initial letter, variable names can also contain letters and numbers 
4. variable_name is case senistive 
5. No spaces or specail characgers are allowed 
6. you can't use a c++ keyword as a varaible name
